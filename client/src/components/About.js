                           Life is the most difficult examination 
                              The history we learn in school doesnâ€™t help us
                              define our future.
                              Most of us know how to add and subtract and
                              not know how to mulply our investments.
                              We know how to do multiple choice.
                              But we struggle to make decisions.
                              We know how to analyze a poet voice.
                              But we cant express ourselves with precision.
                              We learn about the human body and not how
                              to find ourselves.
                              We learn about the brain but not about mental
                              health.
                              We learn about modes of transport but not
                              why travel makes us grow.       
                              Geography taught us where things were but not
                              where Countries wanted to go.
                              We learn about new languages but not about
                              old cultures.
                              We learn about only one perspective  but not
                              opposing opinions.
                              We learn how to draw but not appreciate art.
                              We were always pushed to get to the end but
                              never taught how to start.
                              We were also taught to get over stuff and not
                              how to walk through stuffs.
                              We learned about all plants and the cells in
                              plant.
                              But not the source of our food.
                              We learned how to measure distance but not
                              the journey within.
                              We were told that X is the only place where
                              something was missing.
